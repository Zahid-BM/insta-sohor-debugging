## Answer No - 1 :

Basically JavaScript is a single threaded interpreted programming language.It has only a single call stack. That means it is not like other compiled language that we need to write a full a-z code to execute. JavaScript indeed can process and run small small code command and for this JavaScript inplicitly interprets the small code commands to run using just in time (JIT) compailer process. It uses google's V8 engine to execute the codes in chrome and node.js. From 2015 JavaScript V8 engine using Turbo Fan technology to process the code even more faster than ever. In short, JavaScript runs the written codes in 4 steps. 1. Checks any syntactic errors or not in the written codes. 2. If no syntax error then it creates a special data structure called Abstruct Syntax tree. 3. Then JavaScript converts the codes into machgine readable codes via JIT process called byte codes. 4. Then finally runs the byte codes in system or engine . Most importantly notable that JavaScript has a runtime model to execute the codes named event loop.

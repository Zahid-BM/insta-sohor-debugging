## Answer No - 1 :

Local and session storage are almost same but this is identical.When browser uses storage for a session only then it is called a session storage and when browser uses the storage to store data for a certain period of time or longer time then it is called a local storage. Session storage data is vanished immediately after ending the session but local storage data doesn't vanish even after ending the session. Local storage data stays as long as that is not erased by user.
